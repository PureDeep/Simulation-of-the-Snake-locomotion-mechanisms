Implementation of Snake locomotion mechanisms on the derived Simplified Kinematical Model of discrete Snake Robot in MATLAB.


## Introduction

Snakes use at least five unique modes of terrestrial locomotion. The kind of locomotion a snake uses in any particular instance depends on several factors such as the kind of surface it is crawling on and its speed. 

An elegant way to express gaits for a snake robot is the gait equation, which expresses joint angles as a function of the joint index and the phase of the gait cycle. The general gait equation of snake movements can be expressed as,
